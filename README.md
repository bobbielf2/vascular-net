# Vascular Network Generator

This code generates a circular vascular network that inspired by the retinal network of a zebra fish. The idea of Fibonacci trees are used to generate the network. See the [design process](https://github.com/bobbielf2/vascular-net/blob/master/images/design_process.pdf).
